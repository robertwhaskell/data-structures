# data-structures
Contains a number of classic data structures, implemented in python.
This file contains:
Singly linked list
    Data structure utilizing nodes
Stack
    Data structure utilizing nodes with a "First In, Last Out" 
    organization.
    contains two constructors, one for the data node, and one
    for the stack itself. 
    The stack contains a reference to the first data node, and that
    is all. 
    A node contains a data value, along with a reference to the next
    node.
Parens Tester
    a file containing a function which accepts a string of parense (ie: 
    '((()))()()()()))())(((') and then returns an intenger corresponding
    to that string being open(1), balanced(0), or closed(-1)
